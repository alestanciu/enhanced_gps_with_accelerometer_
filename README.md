# enhanced_gps_with_accelerometer_
The project implemented on ArtyZ7 monitors and acquires physical data from PMOD GPS and PMOD ACL2 and transfers the data through WIFI protocol on a PC. 
On the PC an application written in Java computes the current position based on the acquired data: GPS coordinates and accelerometer X,Y,Z values. The GPS and accelerometer data could be viewed through a GUI (graphic user interface) implemented on the PC. 
The purpose of the project is to complement loss of GPS signal or inaccurate GNSS signal measurement with motion analyzer. 
This project uses ARZYZ7-20 and PMod circuits for data acquisition: PMOD GPS, PMOD ACL and PMOD WiFi.
